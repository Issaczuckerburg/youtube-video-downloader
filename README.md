Downloading videos from YouTube without the proper permissions may be a violation of YouTube Terms of Service. Use at your own discretion.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run `npm run local` to start the Express server
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ to access the app

Note: The vercel deployment does not work because the server is unable to download content (serverless function), so feel free to ignore `vercel.json`
